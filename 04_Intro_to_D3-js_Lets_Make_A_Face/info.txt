Learning points
- ES6 import syntax, unable to do it in this case. Tutor mentioned the need for npm, no terminal in atom yet.
- Check console to see exactly what is happening. Very helpful as it helped me understand style vs attr in d3
- How to group each and every D3 element clearly and concisely thus avoid rewriting code
- For transition(), the transition to happen, the transition is based on the attr mentioned on top
- D3 arc https://github.com/d3/d3-shape/blob/v1.3.7/README.md#arcs, still do not understand all the start angle etc, but now I do
- Positioning of shapes within the SVG canvas
- Transform & Translate Fully
- God D3 is cool!
